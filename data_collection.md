# Data Collection

We'll be primarily using Airbnb data from 3 cities with various cost of living ranges: 
  - Asheville, North Carolina
  - Austin, Texas
  - Boston, Massachusetts
  
Eventually, we might increase our dataset to include other cities with different housing price values, but we have determined these three cities as a good range to start with.
