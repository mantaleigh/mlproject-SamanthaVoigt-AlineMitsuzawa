# Update

## Goal
Our goal set for this milestone was to complete featurization for our dataset. 
In order to accomplish this goal, we had to manually go through every single column in the dataset and decide it's correct feature and NaN representation, which happened to be very time consuming.
By this deadline we have completed both numeric and text featurization.
We have made great progress on categorical featurization, and we are
currently working on implementing our observations.

## Plans
Our plans remain the same.

## To-do
In sum: finish featurizing categorical data, write loading and
aggregation functions for our three types of data, implement linear
regression. See notes.md for more details.

## Difficulties
Featurization has been a challenge especially when it comes to finding
the best way to represent each type of information and making sure that our features
properly match across our numeric, categorical and text files; however,  we
have been able to overcome the problems we have encountered so far and should be
on track given that the second part of our project - that is, the LR implementantion - should be pretty
straightforward.
